For Maze:
You will receive two prefabs, MazeGenerator and MazeCell. Attach the required scripts to each prefab. Place the MazeGenerator prefab in the Scene Hierarchy, and assign the MazeCell prefab to the MazeGenerator component through the Inspector, along with all other necessary content.
After that, you can use it as you want.
